# -Digital-Resume-Project
Step by step - building Digital resume &amp; side-by-side visual comparison of the forked template vs. your custom-built resume

## 🌿 About This Project

This project is my journey into creating a **digital, interactive version of my resume** that can be shared anywhere with just a link. I built **two versions** — one by customizing a forked template, and one completely from scratch — to explore different approaches to web design, HTML/CSS, and GitHub Pages deployment.

Through this process, I learned how to **personalize a pre-made project**, **structure my own from the ground up**, and publish both online for free using GitHub Pages. Whether you’re a developer, designer, or just someone curious about making your own online resume, I hope this project shows that **with a bit of creativity, your professional story can live beautifully on the web**.
